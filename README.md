# Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL for LangChain

This package contains the [LangChain][langchain] integrations for Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL.

> **ðŸ§ª Preview:** This feature is covered by the Pre-GA Offerings Terms of the Google Cloud Terms of Service. Please note that pre-GA products and features might have limited support, and changes to pre-GA products and features might not be compatible with other pre-GA versions.

* [Documentation][docs]
* [API Reference]()

## Getting Started

In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.][project]
2. [Enable billing for your project.][billing]
3. [Enable the Google Cloud SQL API.][api]
4. [Setup Authentication.][auth]

### Installation

Install this library in a [`virtualenv`][venv] using pip. [`virtualenv`][venv] is a tool to
create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of
dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With [`virtualenv`][venv], it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv <your-env>
source <your-env>/bin/activate
<your-env>/bin/pip install langchain-google-cloud-sql-pg
```

## Vector Store Usage

Use a vector store to store embedded data and perform vector search.

```python
from langchain_google_cloud_sql_pg import PostgresVectorstore, PostgresEngine
from langchain.embeddings import VertexAIEmbeddings


engine = PostgresEngine.from_instance("region", "my-instance", "my-database")
embeddings_service = VertexAIEmbeddings()
vectorstore = PostgresVectorStore(
    engine,
    table_name="my-table",
    embeddings=embedding_service
)
```

See the full [Vector Store][vectorstore] tutorial.

## Document Loader Usage

Use a document loader to load data as LangChain `Document`s.

```python
from langchain_google_cloud_sql_pg import PostgresEngine, PostgresLoader


engine = PostgresEngine.from_instance("region", "my-instance", "my-database")
loader = PostgresSQLLoader(
    engine,
    table_name="my-table-name"
)
docs = loader.lazy_load()
```

See the full [Document Loader][loader] tutorial.

## Chat Message History Usage

Use `ChatMessageHistory` to store messages and provide conversation history to LLMs.

```python
from langchain_google_cloud_sql_pg import PostgresChatMessageHistory, PostgresEngine


engine = PostgresEngine.from_instance("region", "my-instance", "my-database")
history = PostgresChatMessageHistory(
    engine,
    table_name="my-message-store",
    session_id="my-session_id"
)
```

See the full [Chat Message History][history] tutorial.
